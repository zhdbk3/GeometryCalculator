> Yeah, you're absolutely right - we're all just 8th graders using pure geometric methods, and you're in 9th grade, already learning coordinate geometry.
How could our method possibly be faster than just setting up a coordinate system??? 😅

## What’s New

* ✨ **Sleeker UI** - Full LaTeX support, friendly to humans ~~and cat-girls~~
* ⚡ **Snappy Performance** - Front-end and back‑end are completely seperated, so the lag from the old version is gone
* 💪 **More Powerful features!!**

  * 🔢 Add unknowns and restrict their value ranges
  * 📍 Smarter, more intuitive point‑adding workflow
  * 📈 Major expression‑parser overhaul

    * 👍 Human‑friendly syntax—no more weird symbols
    * ➡️ Vector operations supported
    * 📄 Conditions can be shown in their original form (rendered with LaTeX), making them easier to manage
  * 📐 Lines: quick parallel / perpendicular tools
  * 🔺 Fast composite constraints: triangle congruence & similarity
  * 🧩 One‑click special shapes: parallelogram, rhombus, rectangle, square, equilateral triangle
  * 🗑️ Cleaner condition deletion
  * 💾 Save data to file & load it back later

## Running the Project in Development Environment

### 1. Install Dependencies

In `frontend/`:

```bash
pnpm install
```

In `backend/`:

```bash
uv sync
```

or

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the Front End

In `frontend/`:

```bash
quasar dev
```

You See the browser tab that just popped up, don't you? Yup, it’s useless lol. Close it.

The front end supports hot-reload, so every change appears instantly without a restart.

### 3. Start the Back End

In `backend/`, run `main_dev.py`. That’s it - the whole stack is up and running!!
